Sample App for Swift Course

I am an instructor with Tech Talent South, teaching an intro to iOS course using Swift. This is the second app we use in class when moving from Playgrounds to building an actual app. This version of the app includes the use of a UITableView and passing data forward through prepareForSegue.
